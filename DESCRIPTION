Description: Gaston provides user-friendly tools to analyze non-respnse in
    survey sampling. Gaston mainly focuses on total nonresponse for now (and
    provides simple functions to correct it using HRG-type methods (HRG =
    Homogenous Response Groups)), but features a few methods useful for partial
    non-response (hot-deck). Another main feature of Gaston is to provide a
    nice setting for calibration (format is close from the one used in the
    popular "Calmar" macro for SAS).
